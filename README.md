E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

This project is a complete end-to-end analysis of an Online Retail (E-Commerce) dataset using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.
It covers the full workflow: loading the dataset, cleaning it, creating new features, exploring the data, and generating meaningful business insights.

What This Project Does
✔ Loads and explores the dataset
✔ Cleans missing values, duplicates, invalid entries, and cancelled invoices
✔ Creates useful new features (TotalPrice, Dates, Categories, Order Size, etc.)
✔ Processes text columns like product names and country names
✔ Filters transactions based on price, quantity, country, and dates
✔ Sorts and ranks transactions by value
✔ Generates summary statistics (revenue, averages, unique counts, etc.)
✔ Performs country-wise, time-wise, customer-wise, and product-wise analysis
✔ Uses grouping and aggregation to find trends
✔ Applies NumPy operations for mathematical processing
✔ Exports cleaned datasets, Excel reports, and summary files

This project is designed to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow, from raw messy data to clean reports.
